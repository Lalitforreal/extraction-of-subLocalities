An Excel database of 26 years and I want to extract the locality of address example house XX, XXXVihar, Raj nagar extension, ghaziabad  with some pincode and I want to extract just the localty(Raj nagar extension) sublocality(XXX vihar)
From the data which is lakhs and lakhs of tuples,
an approach to do so assuming the data(addresses) can be random and all.
